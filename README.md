# Pullback Device: System Design
This repository contains the system design for a pullback device. The device consists of two main components:
- An Arduino, which is used to control the sensors and actuators.
- Sensors or actuators, which are used to detect or respond to the object of interest.

### <br/> Determine the Arduino pins connected to each sensor/actuator
The first step in designing the system is to determine the Arduino pins that will be used to connect each sensor and actuator. This information can be found in the **Arduino_Pins.md** file.

### <br/> Flowchart of the system
The system flowchart can be found in the **Flowchart_System.md** file. This flowchart provides an overview of how the system works.

### <br/> Schematic Design 
The schematic design is created after **Arduino_Pins.md** file was done to determine how the hardware will connect as state in the **Arduino_Pins.md** file

### <br/> PCB Bord
PCB bord, make a PCB bord from the schematic design.
